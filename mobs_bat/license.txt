## Special Thanks:
* License of defense mod: GPL
  (code in this directory of the repo is not derived from the defense mod whatsoever;
  the mod was written by mahmutelmas06 and posted to the official forum thread)
* License of Api  WTFPL Simple Mobs by PilzAdam > Mob Redo by Ten1plus > Redo+ Mahmutelmas06
  (use of the API is considered common knowledge so code in this repo is not a "derivative work")
* duane-r is not listed as an author, since in his words, "The model has
  not been modified. Only the texture file names in it have been
  disabled. This will stop the log spam for those of us who run
  servers."
